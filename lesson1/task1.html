    Hi, Grandpa.

    Hi, Robby.

    Can I help?

    Yes, indeed. Hand me two eggs from the refrigerator (and) I'll (make you two)  fried eggs.

    How about some bacon?

    I made enough for an army. You going to (the) baseball game today?
    It's perfect day for it - (a) little cloudy but nice and warm.

    Dad and I were planing to go the game. But he (has) to work today, and my friends don't want to go.
    It's not (an) important game, anyway.

    Do you have any (other) plans for the day.

    I'll work on my computer. I have new math program and I want learn how (to) use it.

    Maybe you can teach me how to work on a computer some day.

    Anytime. It's really easy, but, like anything, you need to work (at it), Grandpa.

    This bacon is great. I love crispy bacon.

    What are you doing tomorrow?

    Nothing much.
