+<p align="center">Hi, Grandpa.
    +
    +    Hi, Robby.
    +
    +    Can I help?
    +
    +    Yes, indeed. Hand me two eggs from the refrigerator (and) I'll (make you two)  fried eggs.
    +
    +    How about some bacon?
    +
    +    I made enough for an army. You going to (the) baseball game today?
    +    It's perfect day for it - (a) little cloudy but nice and warm.
    +
    +    Dad and I were planing to go the game. But he (has) to work today, and my friends don't want to go.
    +    It's not (an) important game, anyway.
    +
    +    Do you have any (other) plans for the day.
    +
    +    I'll work on my computer. I have new math program and I want learn how (to) use it.
    +
    +    Maybe you can teach me how to work on a computer some day.
    +
    +    Anytime. It's really easy, but, like anything, you need to work (at it), Grandpa.
    +    <img src="2.jpg" alt="Serfing"  align="miidle">
    +    This bacon is great. I love crispy bacon.
    +
    +    What are you doing tomorrow?
    +
    +    Nothing much.
    +
    +    Well, maybe your Dad and I could take you fishing with us.
    +
    +    I'd like that, but...
    +
    +    But what?
    +
    +    But dad is always so busy.
    +
    +    Well, can you come fishing with me tomorrow.
    +
    +    Sure, I can.
    +
    +    Robby says you can't take him to the game today.
    +
    +    I really feel bad (about it). But they need me at the hospital (today), in the children('s) ward.
    +
    +    I understand.
    +
    +    Maybe we can spend some time together next weekend.
    +
    +    Definitely. We should. You and Robbie and me. Remember our first fishing trip.
    +
    +    I (sure) do. Well. I('ve) got to run, Dad. See you later.
    +
    +    Go(ing) fishing.
    +
    +    I'm thinking about it. So, how('s) work?
    +
    +    Oh, the usual problems.
    +
    +    You're working (pretty) hard these days.
    +
    +    I guess, I am.
    +
    +    When did you last go fishing with Robbie?
    +
    +    I remember exactly. It was (his) birthday, June second, two years ago. We didn't catch anything.
    +
    +    Remember our fishing trip?
    +
    +    Yes, I loved them.
    +
    +    Remember catching your first fish?
    +
    +    How I can forget it. I fall out of the (boat). We (had some) good time(s) together.
    +
    +    Yes, we did. Maybe we should do it again.
    +
    +    How about tomorrow?
    +
    +    Don't you have to work?
    +
    +    May paper work will wait.
    +
    +    Robbie will be thrilled. I am, too, Son.
    +
    +    I (want to) spend more time with Robbie.
    +
    +    Tomorrow. It'll be like old time(s for) you and me. And Robbie will love it.
    +
    +    Well, what's the weather going to be like?
    +
    +    Radio says sunny and mild.
    +
    +    Well, I'll tell Robbie. And thanks, Dad.
    +
    +    No thank me. I'm just being a grandfather.
